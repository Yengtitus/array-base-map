# Array Base Map 🚀

Welcome to the "array-base-map" repository! This repository provides a convenient way to apply a callback function to elements in an input array and assign the results to elements in a new output array. This powerful functionality can be achieved using the `map` method in JavaScript.

## Features 🌟

- Allows applying a callback function to elements in an input array
- Assigns results to elements in a new output array
- Utilizes the `map` method for efficient data processing
- Suitable for a wide range of use cases in JavaScript projects

This repository covers the following topics:
- Array manipulation
- Callback functions
- Data processing
- For each loop
- Generic programming
- JavaScript development
- Mapping arrays
- Node.js development
- Standard library usage
- Data structures and types

## Examples 🖥️

Here is a simple example demonstrating how you can use the `map` method to apply a callback function to elements in an array:

```javascript
const inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const outputArray = inputArray.map((element) => element * 2);

console.log(outputArray); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this example, the callback function multiplies each element in the input array by 2, creating a new output array with the transformed values.
